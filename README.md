## SDKs

Azure Communication Services capabilities are conceptually organized into six areas detailed in [conceptual documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/sdk-options). In summary you access the service through:
- **REST-based SDKs:** ARM, Common, Administration, Chat, and SMS, are entirely or partially open-source and published through centralized Azure repos and channels linked below. 
- **REST APIs** are documented in the [Azure REST API repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) and can be used directly over the Internet. 
- **Calling SDKs** linked below and published through a variety of channels.
